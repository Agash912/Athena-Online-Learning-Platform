# Athena Edu - Digital Education Platform

## Introduction
In recent times, the educational landscape has been undergoing a significant transformation. Moving away from the traditional institution-centric approach, there's a discernible shift towards a more decentralized, professor-led model. This evolution is further catalyzed by the proliferation of digital platforms, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage technology in making education both more accessible and affordable.

This project introduces "Athena Edu.", a digital learning platform. Developed using Apache NetBeans and coded in the Java programming language, Athena Edu. has been designed with the end-user in mind. 

It is designed to cater to four distinct user roles: Students, Professors, Admins, and Employers, each with unique functionalities and interactions within the platform.

### Professors
**Professors**: Central to the platformâ€™s educational model, professors from around the globe can register on Athena Edu., offering a diverse range of courses. Their autonomy in course management allows for a dynamic and responsive curriculum, tailored to meet the evolving needs of students.

### Students
**Students**: Students are provided with a rich array of courses from various professors, enabling a flexible and comprehensive learning journey. The platform facilitates their academic progression towards graduation, requiring the successful completion of eight courses as a prerequisite for earning their degree.

### Admins (Platform Owners)
**Admins (Platform Owners)**: Admins have access to a robust analytics dashboard, providing insights into various performance metrics such as student achievements and professor ratings. This data-driven approach empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions to enhance the educational quality and overall user experience on the platform.

### Employers
**Employers**: A novel feature of Athena Edu. is the inclusion of an employer section, fostering a direct connection between the academic and professional realms. Employers can access profiles of graduated students, facilitating recruitment processes by identifying potential candidates for job openings. Furthermore, employers can engage in meaningful dialogues with professors, fostering a synergy that allows course structures to be refined in alignment with industry demands and expectations.
